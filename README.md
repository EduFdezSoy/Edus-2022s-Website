# Edu's 2020's Website [![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/EduFdezSoy)

Once again, my website [edufdez.es](https://edufdez.es)


## Description
At this point this is just an idea more than a website, as before I was thinking on make it in plain `html`+`css`+`js` but my notes make me realice I probably can do a better job using something to generate static content so I just need to make a template. If you happen to be reading this, drop me an issue or something with some suggestion.

## Donations
If you really liked it and feel like I deserve some money, you can buy me a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/EduFdezSoy) and I'll continue transforming caffeine into code!
